<p>Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.</p>

<h2>Columns</h2>

<li>age: age of primary beneficiary</li>

<li>sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male</li>

<li>bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,</li>
<li>objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9</li>

<li>children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents</li>

<li>smoker: Smoking</li></li>

<li>region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.</li>

<li>charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance</li>

<h2>Importing Libraries and Dataset</h2>
<li>Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.</li>

<li>Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.</li>
<li>Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.</li>
<li>Matplotlib/Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.</li>
<li>Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.</li>
<li>XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.</li>
